<h2> Human Rights Should Apply to People of <em> All </em> Ages</h2>

<p> Scientific data can play a big part in creating a campaign and being able to support ones evidence in their claim. </p>
<p>By 2030 the percentage of people age 65 and older is expected to increase from almost 13% to almost 20%, according to data from the Stanford Center on Longevity. The percentage will inevitably increase soon because of the move in generations soon. This means we will have more money for the economy, but it should not go to our government. The money should go to the elders and out into their retirement funding. They need to end the overflowing retirement homes and more money needs to be put into the smaller ones. When you are at that point, you deserve to live a luxurious life, and our elders are not given that luxury as of now. There are about 135 retirement homes in LA, and less than half are over 3 stars in ratings. How sad is that?</p> 
<p>To the right is a diagram of the increase of retirement home population. We need to stop this ASAP.</p>
