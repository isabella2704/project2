<p> There are many issues in the world people can make campaigns and spread awareness about.</p>
<p>One topic I never see is Ageism. Ageism is discrimination against one based on their age (young or old). This discrimination can effect anyone. It is most common in the workplace, out in public, or even worse, in private. There are countless tragedies about people who have been beaten, not giving fair treated, or simply disrespected because of their age. Someone being extremely young or old, does not give anyone the right to walk all over them, and they cannot even defend themselves. Learn more about ageism and its effects on the world in more depth below. </p>
