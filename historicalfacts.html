<h2> Historical Facts</h2>


<p>“Until our society builds [a] more balanced perspective about age groups, this lends to embittered withdrawal by old people” 
(Bernstein, 1969). The term “ageism” was made in 1969 by Robert N. Butler. He first used this word in an interview with the interviewer Carl Bernstein from the Washington Post. He talked about how people should never be discriminated by this they can not control. He related sexism, racism, homophobia, because he wanted to express common discrimationa dn why it is unfair. He was passionate about ageism since he was young, and brought in awareness.</p> 

<p>In Florida today, there is an example of ageism hidden in plain sight. After reaching the age of 40, you are not protected by ADEA anymore (Age Discrimination in Amployment Act). They are not protected and get paid fairly lower than younger workers, and this is only one example of ageism in the U.S. </p>
