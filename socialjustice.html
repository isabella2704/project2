<h2>Social Justice</h2>
<h3> Human Rights Should Apply to People of <em> All </em> Ages </h3>

<p>Ageism is without a doubt considered a social justice issue. Justice is supposed to be fair for everyone, and ageism contradicts that. Being confined to poorly paid work or being denied access to making money by labor altogether. Deprivation could also be a factor. It can relate to being denied a stable or enjoyable place to live because of your position regarding age. Social justice has tons of components to it. Like sexism, racism, and more, ageism discriminates against a group of people in some way shape or form. Everyone deserves justice no matter who or what you are. We all deserve to be treated fairly! </p>
