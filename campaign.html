<h3>Human Rights Should Apply to People of <em> All </em> Ages </h3>
<p>Elder abuse, child abuse, and overall direspect to people of different ages all ties into discrimination.
 You have probably felt it in at least one day of your life. 
 When you have been treated unfairly because you are too young or old, that is ageism. 
 We should not let people continue this any longer. </p>
 <p>It is one of the most socially condoned and institutionalized forms of prejudice in the United States.It is been an issue since the beginning of time, but only 50 years ago was the term invented.</p> <center> <p> HUMAN RIGHTS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE BY AGE</p>

<p>Get educated, speak up, and let your voice be heard today. </p>
