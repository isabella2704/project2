<header> Human Rights Should Apply to People of <em> All </em> Ages </header>


<p>Ageism does not just affect people in public. In private, you can see a decrease of money on your <em> paycheck </em> if you are of a higher age. Some private companies do not pay the lederly as much because they take their work as less valuable. </p><p>This affects peoples living conditions, plans for retirement, and more elderly people will be stationed in retirement homes because of the high rent, and how little they make now. </p><p>In September, research showed that over 27% of full-time workers over 55 years of age increasingly hold low-paying jobs. Meanwhile, 19% of workers below 55 hold high-paying jobs, according to Teresa Ghilarducci, professor of economics at The New School for Social Research. </p><p>These affects around the environment are unhealthy. With lower paying jobs, and overflowing retirement homes, our elders deserve so much better than this. It will affect all of us when we are older, so SPEAK UP NOW! </p>
